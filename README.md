## Suspension and Powertrain Member
As one of the Suspension and Powertrain Engineers on Liberty University's Formula Competition Team, I focused on the SolidWorks design of the vehicle’s core powertrain and suspension components. This repository highlights my individual contributions to the powertrain and suspension subteams.

## Powertrain Component Design
Modeled major components in SolidWorks, ensuring manufacturable geometry, proper tolerances, and assembly fit:
-Crankshaft

-Transmission Input Shaft & Output Shaft

SolidWorks:
-Friction & Steel Disks
-Clutch Basket
-Drivetrain Pump

All models include reference images for quick viewing.

## Suspension System Modeling
Designed and integrated key suspension components:
-Steering Shaft
-Heave Damper Sensor Attachment

Focused on stiffness, packaging constraints, and compatibility with existing system geometry.

## What I Learned
Through my work on both the powertrain and suspension teams, I gained experience in:
-Advanced SolidWorks part modeling, assemblies, and design intent
-Understanding powertrain and suspension system interactions within a formula-style vehicle
-Working with subsystem-specific design requirements and packaging constraints
-Applying engineering reasoning to ensure reliability, stiffness, and functionality
