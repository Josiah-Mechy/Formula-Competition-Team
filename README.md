As one of the Suspension and Powertrain Engineers on Liberty University's collegiate Formula Competition Team, I focused on theSolidWokrs design of the vehicle’s core powertrain and suspension components. This repository highlights my individual contributions to the powertrain and suspension subteams.

Powertrain Component Design

Modeled major components in SolidWorks, ensuring manufacturable geometry, proper tolerances, and assembly fit:

Crankshaft

Transmission Input Shaft & Output Shaft

Friction & Steel Disks

Clutch Basket

Drivetrain Pump

All models include reference images for quick viewing.

🏎️ Suspension System Modeling

Designed and integrated key suspension components:

Steering Shaft

Heave Damper Sensor Attachment

Focused on stiffness, packaging constraints, and compatibility with existing system geometry.
